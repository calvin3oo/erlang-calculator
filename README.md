# Overview

In this project, I demonstrate my ability to pick up new software. I stretched myself with taking on a new way to approach programming by looking into functional programming in Erlang.

This program is rather basic and provides some basic functionality of a calculator. It can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and factorials.

My purpose for writing this is to learn Erlang and to better understand the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming by trying out a functional programming language.

# Future Work

* Add support for string inputs to the calculator.
* Add support for more complex operations such as powers and roots.
